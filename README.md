# bookworm-training-polymer2.0

this is a _very beginner_ codelab using **polymer 2.0**

## getting started

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Install [Bower](https://bower.io/) with npm install -g bower
* Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Install [Polymer-cli](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli) with npm install -g polymer-cli

##Step 1

In the step_1 folder you will find all the step in the README.md to accomplish your first step with polymer. It's abot creating a polymer project

##Step 2

in the step_2 you will create a new element the **todo_list_element**


##Step 3

in the step_3 you will add some attribute and use some data binding helpers dom-repeat and dom-if.


##Step 4

in the step_4 you will learn how to use custom style to style element easily and maintain it.


##Step 5

in this last step we will use [Polymer UI Elements](https://www.webcomponents.org/collection/PolymerElements/paper-ui-elements) to let our todo-list-element become attractive !
