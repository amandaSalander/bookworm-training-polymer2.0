| file or folder name | explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| bower_components  | Your app has a set of dependencies - chunks of code that it depends on to work. These dependencies are managed with Bower, a package manager, and stored in the bower_components folder.  |
| src/  | Folder that stores the code we'll write for your app - html, javascript and css. |
|test/|A placeholder folder for automated tests. You won't need this since you will test your app manually.|
|bower.json|Describes your app's dependencies to the package manager, Bower.|
|polymer.json|stores information about your project structure and desired build configuration(s). It is used by the Polymer CLI as a way to understand the structure of your application.|
|manifest.json|Stores metadata for your app that helps browsers to load it efficiently.|
|index.html|Your app's landing page.|
|README.md|README files usually describe how to install and use the app. Currently, yours contains some default content generated by the Polymer CLI.|
